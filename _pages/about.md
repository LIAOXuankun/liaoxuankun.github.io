I am currently a senior algorithm engineer at [TongYi](https://tongyi.aliyun.com/welcome). I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/v1/), Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU), supervised by [Prof. Jianliang Xu](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~xujl/). I was a member of the [Database Group](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~db/). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the School of Electronic Information and Communications [(EIC)](http://ei.hust.edu.cn/English/Home.htm), Huazhong University of Science and Technology [(HUST)](https://www.hust.edu.cn/) in 2020.
